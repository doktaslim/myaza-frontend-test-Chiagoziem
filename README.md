## Assumptions
The data used was dummy data for markup.


## Additional notes
The styles used in the project was not consistent.
This did not really test out React's functionalities but instead focused more on design and aesthatics over functionalities.
No tests could be carried out as it was a design replication. Tests should be more focused on business logic which none was provided in the instructions.
Optimaztions could not be possible too as it was all about design replication.
